It keeps your apps secure by default, i.e., Digital Ocean creates, manages, and renews the SSL certificates while protecting your apps from DDoS attacks.
You can deploy the source code directly from your GitHub repositories (support for GitLab and Bitbucket is coming soon). You can also enable ‘Autodeploy on Push,’ which automatically re-deploys the app each time you push to the branch containing the source code.</description></item></channel></rss>
